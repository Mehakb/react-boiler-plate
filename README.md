## About boiler plate

Boiler plate created on machine using react 17.0.1, node 14.15.4, npm 6.14.10

With this boiler plate you can start to code for components directly.


It includes create-react-app, tailwind css, postcss-cli, autofixer packages.
This bolier plate has much of extra content removed.


Benefit of tailwind css is that it is javascript css and also on building for production it removes extra tailwind css classes and bundles only classes we used so reduce css to minimum size.
